This game is based on the Realm Rush section of the GameDev.tv Unity 3D course.

My original implementations are:

- Completely different aesthetics and level design.
- 9 different enemy types with distinct behaviour.
- 3 different tower types.
- Different AI behaviours through a different pathfinding algorithm. I introduced a concept of "danger level" on paths generated depending on the towers deected along. Passive enemies always follow the least dangerous path while attacking enemies always follow the most dangerous to try and clear out defense towers.
- Implemented 40 waves in total.
- Player is able to see a preview of the tower in place before placing it. They can also see a preview of its range.
- Added UI pop-ups to explain characteristics of new enemies and towers as they pop up.
- Added in-game menus to accelerate/slow down the game, pause it and to select the tower to build.
